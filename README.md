# enough
A CLI tool to take control over distractions (currently only for macOS).

## Install
```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/fruit-bird/enough
```

## Usage
Through the config file you create at `~/.config/enough/enough.yaml` (or by running `enough init`), you can define different profiles with websites and apps to block. You can then run `enough` to start blocking distractions.

```yaml
default-profile: lock-in
profiles:
  lock-in:
    duration: 1h30m
    websites:
      - https://www.youtube.com
      - https://reddit.com
```

Then run `enough` to start blocking distractions:

```bash
sudo enough block --profile=lock-in
sudo enough block --duration=2h # overrides duration, uses default profile
```

## What is This?
Yk the drill, every project is a learning opportunity. [SelfControl](https://github.com/SelfControlApp/selfcontrol/) is an amazing app that had me wondering how it worked. So I made this.

I later learned that [Raycast Focus](https://www.raycast.com/core-features/focus) is a similar thing that does it admittedly better. I will definitely be using that instead, as my implementation is definitely neither optimized nor stress-tested.

Regardless I still like seeing that config file in my dotfiles üòÅ
